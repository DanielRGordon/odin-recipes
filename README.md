# odin-recipes
This is my first project through the Odin Project curriculum where I will be creating a main page which will link to several separate pages with different recipes. It won't look pretty at all but it is a start. 

In this project I learned a lot about using Git and Github and became much more comfortable using them.

I got great practice in adding headers, images, paragraphs, lists, and hyperlinks.
